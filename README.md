# donkey_gym

OpenAI gym environment for donkeycar simulator with reward function equal to velocity.

# Legal notice

Package is under MIT license. *Authored by Tawn Kramer and original sources located [here](https://github.com/tawnkramer/sdsandbox/tree/donkey/src/donkey_gym)*. The only reason this was moved to a separate repo is the fact that fork contains a simulator itself and package installation via pip takes ages, because of slow git clone.
